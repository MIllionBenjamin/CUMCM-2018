For different manufacturing procedures, thinking about the location and classification of CNC (computer number controller), we provided specific dynamic scheduling strategies through genetic algorithm (based on greedy algorithm method). In addition, we added the random malfunction factor into our model. The factory can adjust RGV's work strategy according to our model to maximize the production efficiency.
