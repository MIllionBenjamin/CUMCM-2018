-	Team work. Finish the paper Research on Dynamic Scheduling Strategy for Intelligent Rail Guide Vehicle (RGV) based on Greedy Algorithm in Chinese.
- My contribution (Wang Mingye's Contribution): Write all programs (Python). The programs are to simulate the productive processes.


For different manufacturing procedures, thinking about the location and classification of CNC (computer number controller), we provided specific dynamic scheduling strategies through genetic algorithm (based on greedy algorithm method). In addition, we added the random malfunction factor into our model. The factory can adjust RGV's work strategy according to our model to maximize the production efficiency.
